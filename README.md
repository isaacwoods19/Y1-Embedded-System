# Y1-Embedded-System
Module for learning and creating an embedded system on an Arduino.

For this project, we had to learn how to code in a C++ variation for Arduino. The project needed to simulate a virtual pet on an Arduino board with LCD, that would perform multiple functions over time and allow the user to interact with it, for example feeding it to make it happier.

This module was great fun and I learned a lot, I recieved a 1st for it.
